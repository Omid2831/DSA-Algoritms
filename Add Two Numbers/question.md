## Add Two Numbers

### Problem Description

You are given two **non-empty linked lists** representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each node contains a **single digit**.

Add the two numbers and return the result as a **linked list**, also in reverse order.

You may assume:

* The two numbers do **not** contain leading zeros, except the number `0` itself.
* Each node stores **exactly one digit**.
* The lists can be of **different lengths**.

### Example

**Input**

```
l1 = [2,4,3]
l2 = [5,6,4]
```

**Explanation**

* `l1` represents **342**
* `l2` represents **465**
* Sum = **807**

**Output**

```
[7,0,8]
```
